This repository also contains a general requirement file, and this file contains all the packages necessary for the execution of all the proposed solutions. The installation can be done as followed:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

As a notice, some packages are not the latest version; some limitations of my hardware cause this. The proposed approaches are based on **Python 3.6**. Each folder contains his **MARKDOWN** for the detailed explanation and overview of the suggested methods.
